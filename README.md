## Overview

Starting with episode 2 of The .NET Show, I am building a mobile podcast app for my podcast, .NET Rocks! using Xamarin Forms. 

At this point our app has a HomePage which shows the first 20 episodes of the podcast. The user can load more episodes (20 at a time). For each episode, we provide a button so the user can see the details and play the podcast.

However, the user can only **Play** and **Stop**. There is no **Pause** function. Nor is there a way to scrub - or jump to a specific location in the audio.

In this episode we will:

- Provide controls for **Play**, **Pause**, **Resume**, and **Stop**.
- Provide  **Scrub** control.
- Provide controls to **Jump Back** and **Jump Ahead** by 10 seconds.
